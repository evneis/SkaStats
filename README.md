# SkaStats - A Counter-Strike Stats Bot
This Discord bot will allow users in a discord server to see their stats in Counter-Strike

## Available Commands
### Register (/register {username})
This command is required for all future commands - adds an association with your discord id to your steam name. It is really important to note that the username is based on your steam profile URL - after the /id/
- This will need to map to steam KEY instead of username in the future
### Stats (/stats)
Returns Stats of the user including kill/death ratio, Accuracy, Headshot Percentage, Win/Loss ratio, Total earned money
### Maps (/map {map name/list})
Returns wins and win percentage based on round. Put "list" instead of a map to see available maps to query

## Planned Functionality
### Weapons (/weapon {weapon name})
