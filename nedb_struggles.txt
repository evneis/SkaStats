ENOENT error - deifnitely caused by multiple files opening the users.db at the same time
 
We donâ€™t need a new API to have singletons, just abstract it with a local module of your own, e.g.
db.js:
const Datastore = require('nedb');
const db = {
  tableName: new Datastore({ filename: '...' })
};
module.exports = db;
    
    -Great thinking so far - need a way to point to parent folder on import in the command files

I met the same problem, but i found that error appears when creating multiple instances of datastore with same filename. 
You have to instantialize datastore only once and keep reference across whole app. 
May be developers should provide singleton/factory 
(for example var db = require('nedb').open({filename: 'path/to/file'}) ) instead of creating instances
