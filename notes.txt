npm Scripts

    npm i discord.js axios dotenv filesystem
    npm i nedb --save


# TASK LIST
    Later on: Make a fancier response (graphs? images?) - https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/embeds.html#embed-preview
    Add a select menu for maps/weapons 
    Map command structure
        %map {map} - returns an overview of information about that map
        %map wins - returns which map you have the most wins on (maybe top 3?)

Where we at 
    Need to figure out slash commands (why is /rockpaperscissors coming up? where did that come from?)
    WHat other info can we get from message object
        look at discord.js documentation

# API Alternatives
    Try using steams official API - might be more helpful
    https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview - look up tutorial (using steam webapi for csgo stats)

## Currently stuck
    axios/discord - else if will return an axios error even if it matches the if statement completely

# Stats Suggestions
    KD
    Accuracy
    HS%
    W/L

Need to look into sending 2 replies for formatting sake

Some text formatting notes:
    Give this a shot - possible solution for multiple messages
message.channel.send({embed: {
      color: 3447003,
      title: "Test:",
      fields: [
        { name: "Test 1", value: "Line1\nLine2\nLine3", inline: true},
        { name: "Test 2", value: "AlsoLine1\nAlsoLine2\nAndLine3", inline: true}
      ]
    }
  });
