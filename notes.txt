    npm i nedb --save


# TASK LIST
    Add a select menu for maps/weapons 
    Figure out more nedb shtuff
        upsert seems to add another entry - any way around that?
            seems to auto delete after another run - will be interesting to see how this works in practice
    Now that register seems to be working, I need to integrate this into the other methods 
        Consider: db.persistence.compactDataFile - will compact the db instead of on next load
    Database is acting really wonky
        will error out until I run firstDatabaseRun
        Perhaps call a load function in index4.js

    After sufficient testing - start working on the weapon command
        this will be the most challenging to parse
            perhaps make a master list to send, translate user inputs to API data 




# API Alternatives
    Try using steams official API - might be more helpful
        Try this for the fancy SkaStats 2.0
    https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview - look up tutorial (using steam webapi for csgo stats)

## Currently stuck

# Stats Suggestions

# WEAPON NOTES
Should query on toLowerCase(metadata.name) - this value makes more human sense than the key
## Weapon Stats
    Key/name
    Kills - displayValue
    Shot Fired - displayValue
    Shot Accuracy - display value
