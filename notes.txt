# TASK LIST
    Add ERROR CODESSSS
        embedded error codes for:
            im sure theres more
    Clean Up logs and code
    Look into global slash commands - will remove the need for a guild id
    
    GOOD PRACTICE - construct actual error logs that would be useful for debugging (e.g which user tried what at when)
        Not worth the effort on a small scale like this but would be good practice/habit
    
    After this is ran on production for a while - should definitely clean up old code and stuff




# API Alternatives
    Try using steams official API - might be more helpful
        Try this for the fancy SkaStats 2.0
    https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview - look up tutorial (using steam webapi for csgo stats)

        Vultr - roughly $2.50 a month - requires a bit of setup
    Raspberry Pi
        This is intriguing, I have a pi laying around

## Weapon Stats
    Key/name
    Kills - displayValue
