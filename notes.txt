# TASK LIST
    ##Figure out save a JSON object
        Current implementation is saving it as this weird kinda subobjects - might have to look more into JSON to figure this out
        https://v8.dev/ - this might be useful
        Need to query/print from a JSON list - e.g multiple different maps
    Parse JSON object to return necessary information
    Build a string response with that information  
        Later on: Make a fancier response (graphs? images?)
