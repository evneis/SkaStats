# TASK LIST
    Later on: Make a fancier response (graphs? images?)

Where we at 
    Need to figure out slash commands (why is /rockpaperscissors coming up? where did that come from?)
    WHat other info can we get from message object
        look at discord.js documentation

# API Alternatives
    Try using steams official API - might be more helpful
    https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview - look up tutorial (using steam webapi for csgo stats)

## Currently stuck
    axios/discord - else if will return an axios error even if it matches the if statement completely

# Stats Suggestions
    KD
    Accuracy
    HS%
    W/L
    Bank
Need to look into sending 2 replies for formatting sake

Some text formatting notes:
    Give this a shot - possible solution for multiple messages
message.channel.send({embed: {
      color: 3447003,
      title: "Test:",
      fields: [
        { name: "Test 1", value: "Line1\nLine2\nLine3", inline: true},
        { name: "Test 2", value: "AlsoLine1\nAlsoLine2\nAndLine3", inline: true}
      ]
    }
  });
