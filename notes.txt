# TASK LIST
    Build a string response with that information  
        Look up what the most efficient way to query a JSON list for an item
    Later on: Make a fancier response (graphs? images?)

Where we at 
    For some reason tracker api is broken now
    Need to figure out slash commands (why is /rockpaperscissors coming up? where did that come from?)
    Need to make breaks in responses
    WHat other info can we get from message object
        look at discord.js documentation

# API Alternatives
    Try using steams official API - might be more helpful
    https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview - look up tutorial (using steam webapi for csgo stats)

## Currently stuck
    axios/discord - else if will return an axios error even if it matches the if statement completely

Need to look into sending 2 replies for formatting sake

Some text formatting notes:
    Give this a shot - not sure if it works in content.
content: {embed: {
      color: 3447003,
      title: "Test:",
      fields: [
        { name: "Test 1", value: "Line1\nLine2\nLine3", inline: true},
        { name: "Test 2", value: "AlsoLine1\nAlsoLine2\nAndLine3", inline: true}
      ]
    }
  });
