Examples in documentation:
    localStorage.setItem("myCat", "Tom");
    const cat = localStorage.getItem("myCat");
Application: 
    key should be discordId and value should be query term
    What happens when you run: %r hirachidiamonds?
        Check localdb for instance of discordId 
            If exists:
                replace with message content (.set())
            If not:
                Create entry - probably same commands
    When stat request is ran, query for username and insert it into url
    What about something like: %r -r
        Either delete entry with discordId or nullify - localStorage.removeItem("myCat");
            Will need to throw and error if name is null when querying
